# John's Farm

## Inspiration

We were inspired to create a fun, yet challenging, strategy game to simulate growing crops on a farm. We were also inspired to learn Unity and create a game from scratch with just the bare basics.

## Purpose

The purpose of John's Farm is to simualate the different factors that go into real farming through a simpler, compact game. Despite having a fraction of the different factors that come along with maintaining a farm, John's Farm is already complex to a point where it is hard to establish a clear decision or strategy from the get go. This allows us to demonstrate the many different calculations that companies like John Deere need to go through to optimize their equipment.

## How we built it

We designed our game using Unity and C#, with sprites from [https://opengameart.org/](https://opengameart.org).

## Challenges

We built this game entirely using Unity, which we were unfamiliar with at the beginning. Some challenges we faced related to finding a way to change the prices of the crops and how to balance out the buy/sell ratio and the reward to time ratio for each crop. We wanted to make the game easy to pick up, but challenging to optimize the efficiency of crop growing. Another challenge we faced along the way was animating and presenting the sprites such that they would look good on multiple different screen resolutions. This way everyone could enjoy Johnâ€™s Farm.

## Accomplishments and what we learned

We are proud of how the final UI of the game came out. It fit the retro vibe of our game and the graphics ran smoothly to present our final product. Without knowing much unity coming in to Boillermake, we are happy with the complexity and overall aesthetic we were able to introduce into the game.

## What's next

We said in the video that we wanted to host this on the web, but we managed to get it done on time! Check it out [here](https://exaphis.github.io/johns-farm/). In the future, we'd like to add more crops and interactions between them, as well as difficulty modes to create a higher skill cap to the game. There are many different avenues that we can take to make John's Farm and we hope to explore some!
